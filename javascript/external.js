    'The Zillow Rental Listings map, developed by Zillow, Inc., \
    provides users a robust spatial view of houses and apartments \
    for rent in an area of their choosing. The application provides \
    selection by lasso method for spatial filtering. As the main \
    purpose is finding the ideal house/apartment for the user, \
    there are many attribute filtering methods as well. \
    Users can filter by number of bedrooms and bathrooms, \
    house type, square footage, lot size, age, number of \
    stories, basement, tours, pet policy, other amenities, \
    type of view, number of days on the site, and any keywords. \
    If I was signed into my Zillow account, I could save this \
    home to my account for later viewing. One flaw I find in this \
    web mapping application is the lack of a distance tool. \
    What if I wanted to find homes within 30 miles of a particular \
    city? After signing in, it would also be useful to export the \
    userâ€™s list of saved homes to a CSV file for offline viewing.'

    'The Windy Weather Map, developed by Windy, offers advanced \
    capabilities for the visualization, tracking, and forecasting \
    of climate and weather patterns. This application is as \
    intuitive as it can be given the all the functionality it \
    offers. If I were asked to redesign the application, I probably \
    would provide an option to change the color ramps. I would also \
    modify how the layers are presented on the main screen, as I \
    found the two separate menus pointing to the same master panel \
    of layers confusing. A simple bubble that presents a scrollable \
    list of all layers would have taken up less space. However, \
    I am aware that the paid version of this application might \
    provide these features.'
